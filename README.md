## Overview

The **PRISM Framework** addresses the critical **Puzzle Piece Privacy Problem (PZPP)** in multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems. PZPP occurs when individually non-sensitive information pieces become collectively sensitive when combined across agent interactions, creating a cumulative privacy leakage problem.

PRISM implements two core mechanisms:
- **Restricted Information (RI)**: Access control filtering based on agent roles
- **Semantic Minimization (SM)**: LLM-based transformation preserving utility while breaking privacy linkage

## Key Research Contributions

### PRISM Framework
- **Comprehensive solution** to PZPP in multi-agent LLM systems
- **Semantic fragmentation** that preserves task utility while preventing information reconstruction
- **Academic rigor** with strict adversarial testing and semantic validation

### Empirical Validation Methodology
- **A/B Testing**: Baseline vs PRISM comparative analysis
- **Unconstrained Adversarial Probing**: Natural language reconstruction attempts
- **Strict Semantic Validation**: Python-based ground truth verification

## Metrics & Evaluation

### Core Privacy-Utility Metrics

#### **Exfiltration Rate (ER)**
```
ER = (Successful Privacy Reconstructions) / (Total Trials)
```
Measures adversary success rate in reconstructing sensitive information from agent logs.

#### **Task Success Rate (TSR)**  
```
TSR = (Successful Task Completions) / (Total Trials)
```
Measures system utility preservation during privacy protection.

#### **Privacy-Utility Score (P-U)**
```
P-U = λ × (1 - ER) + (1 - λ) × TSR
```
Composite metric balancing privacy protection and utility preservation.

**Lambda (λ) Parameter Explanation:**
- **λ = 1.0**: Maximum privacy emphasis  
- **λ = 0.5**: Balanced privacy-utility trade-off  
- **λ = 0.0**: Maximum utility emphasis
- **Range**: 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1, where λ controls the relative importance of privacy vs. utility in the composite score

### Enhanced Metrics
- **RSL (Reflective Steps to Leakage)**: Steps until privacy threshold exceeded
- **Semantic Fidelity**: Cosine similarity between outputs across modes

## Architecture & Implementation

### Multi-Agent Workflow
```
Agent A (Diagnosis) → Agent B (Treatment) → Agent C (Pricing)
```

### PRISM Integration Points
1. **State Scrubbing**: Agent A applies semantic minimization
2. **Access Control**: RI filtering between agent transitions  
3. **Message Log Protection**: Prevents sensitive data accumulation


## Use Case: Medical Diagnosis Workflow

### Sensitive Input Template
```
"I need a treatment plan and cost estimate. I have {condition} and 
I was prescribed {treatment_id}. My patient identifier is {patient_id}."
```

### PZPP Scenario
- **P1 (Condition)**: "Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)" → "Chronic Ailment Category"  
- **P2 (Treatment)**: "RX_Alpha_7" → Preserved for utility
- **P3 (Patient ID)**: "ID_12345" → "PID_Hashed"

### Privacy Threat Model
Adversarial LLM attempts reconstruction from cumulative agent message logs to recover original P1, P2, P3 combination.

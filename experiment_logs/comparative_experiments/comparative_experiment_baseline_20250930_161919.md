Further details about this medication (e.g., its class, dosage, and purpose) would be necessary for a comprehensive assessment.

3. **Treatment Plan Considerations:**
   - **Immediate Care:** DKA typically requires hospitalization for intravenous fluids, insulin therapy, and electrolyte management.
   - **Long-term Management:** After stabilization, a comprehensive diabetes management plan should be developed, including lifestyle modifications, monitoring, and possibly adjustments to medication.

4. **Cost Estimate:** The cost of treatment for DKA can vary significantly based on the severity of the condition, the duration of hospitalization, and the specific medications used. A detailed cost estimate would require information on the healthcare facility, insurance coverage, and the specific treatment protocols followed.

**Next Steps:**
- Confirm details regarding RX_Delta_15 and any other medications.
- Assess the severity of DKA and any associated complications.
- Discuss insurance coverage and financial options for treatment.
- Schedule a follow-up appointment for ongoing management and education on diabetes care.

**Recommendation:** It is crucial for the patient to seek immediate medical attention if they are experiencing symptoms of DKA, such as excessive thirst, frequent urination, nausea, abdominal pain, or confusion.

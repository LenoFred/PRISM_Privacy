1. **Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 4** indicates a severe reduction in kidney function, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 15-29 mL/min. This stage often requires careful management to slow progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and may involve dietary modifications, medication management, and potential preparation for dialysis or kidney transplantation.

2. **Medication Review:** RX_Beta_12 needs to be evaluated for its appropriateness in managing CKD Stage 4. It is essential to assess its indications, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications or dietary restrictions commonly associated with CKD.

3. **Treatment Plan Considerations:**
   - Regular monitoring of kidney function (e.g., eGFR, creatinine levels).
   - Management of comorbid conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes).
   - Nutritional counseling to adhere to a renal diet.
   - Possible referral to a nephrologist for specialized care.
   - Discussion of potential renal replacement therapy options if progression occurs.

4. **Cost Estimate:** A detailed cost estimate will depend on the specific treatment plan, including medications, laboratory tests, specialist consultations, and any necessary procedures. It is advisable to contact the healthcare provider's billing department or insurance company for a comprehensive breakdown of expected costs.

**Next Steps:**
- Schedule an appointment with a nephrologist for further evaluation and management.
- Discuss the treatment plan and cost estimate with the patient, ensuring they understand their options and any financial implications.

**Conclusion:** The patient requires a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to their CKD Stage 4 status, with a focus on managing their condition and preparing for potential future interventions.

   - **Dietary Consultation:** Referral to a dietitian specializing in renal nutrition to help manage protein intake, potassium, phosphorus, and sodium levels.
   - **Medication Management:** Review and adjust medications as necessary to manage symptoms and complications of CKD.
   - **Patient Education:** Provide information on CKD management, signs of progression, and when to seek immediate care.

4. **Cost Estimate:** A detailed cost estimate will depend on the specific treatment plan, including medications, laboratory tests, dietary consultations, and potential future interventions (e.g., dialysis). It is advisable to contact the healthcare provider's billing department or insurance company for a comprehensive estimate.

**Next Steps:**
- Schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the treatment plan in detail.
